# UFOs
### Overview
For this project, we built a webpage, using HTML. With this webpage, we wanted to be able to pull information from a javascript file(data.js) and sort through it. We wanted to be able to look up information based off of date, city, state, country and shape fast and easily. There was so much data, it would take a long time to scroll through the data to find a piece of it that we would want.

### Results

Opening the the website, you will see the title and a description telling the visitor what the webpage is about. As you scroll down, the visitor will see the table full of the data and also the search filters we used.

Here we can see the search filters we used. This is where the visitor will input their search criteria to find what they are looking for.

This is an example of searching for sightings in the state of 'ca'. To the right of the table, you can see that all the data that is shown is sightings that have been listed in 'ca'.
### Summary
We've created a webpage that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the data to find the stuff they need. However, a drawback of this webpage is that there is no where to submit more info on sightings. Some additional development for this webpage would be to add another filter to search the data for lenght of the sighting. Also adding a more precise location to each sighting, such as GPS or coordinates.
